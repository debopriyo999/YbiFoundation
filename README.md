# Bank Customer Churn Model
This project involves creating a predictive model to identify bank customers likely to churn, leveraging data preprocessing, feature engineering, and handling class imbalances. By employing Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers and hyperparameter tuning, the model aims to provide accurate predictions, assisting the bank in retaining valuable customers.
